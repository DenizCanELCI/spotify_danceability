# spotify_danceability
- The development of a Machine Learning model that guesses the danceability scores of Spotify songs ( (of 140k tracks in Spotify). 
- The model uses gradient boosting and hyperparameter optimization to achieve the most accurate results -less than 10% error!
- The project is able to create the playlist on user's own account using the Spotify Python API!
- model.py - Inludes whole model structure. At the end of hyperparameter optimization on 3 different models we got an RMSE score less than 0.1.
- model_ML_Pipeline.py : When you run this on python from cmd, a webapp starts locally on your machine to run the program.
- requirements.txt: Python module dependencies and versions are here.

Installation:
  pip install -r requirements.txt (works better on pycharm virtual environment!)

Creation of dummy Spotify project (Will be done only once!):
  TBD
  
How to run (on Windows):
  1 - Install dependencies as written below in "Installation"Ã‡
     pip install -r requirements.txt on command line \n
  2 - Run "model_ML_Pipeline.py" from commandline \n
  3 - On command line there is a local address that web app tuns on your machine, click on it to open app. \n
  4 - Enter your spotify userid, client id (from dummy Spotify project) and client secret (from dummy Spotify project) to web app as inputs and hit 'Submit' \n
  5 - Web app runs and gives you the output sucj as "Hello 99999999999 The ML Dance Playlist has been created:  \n
	ML Dance Playlist 14_48_time". \n
