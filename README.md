# spotify_danceability

- The development of a Machine Learning model that guesses the danceability scores of Spotify songs ( (of 140k tracks in Spotify). 
- The model uses gradient boosting and hyperparameter optimization to achieve the most accurate results -less than 10% error!
- The project is able to create the playlist on user's own account using the Spotify Python API!

- model.py - Inludes whole model structure. At the end of hyperparameter optimization on 3 different models we got an RMSE score less than 0.1.

- A template for web app also started on same document. 

We accept everyone wanting to gain experience as contributors :)
